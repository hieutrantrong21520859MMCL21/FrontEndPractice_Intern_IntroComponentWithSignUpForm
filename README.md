# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

## 1. Overview

The challenge is to build out this **Intro component with sign up form** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
